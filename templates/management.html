    <p>Successful construction management (CM) is sometimes measured by the ability of a management team to complete a percentage of planned work to align with the project schedule. Project success can be measured upon the ability to classify, coordinate and intuitively manage three constraints known as “the iron triangle”, which includes time, cost and quality. Each one of these constraints having a direct influence on the other two constraints and the successful outcome of a project. Waste associated to each of the constraints can have an impact on a project, this can be wasted working hours, material waste or energy waste. Construction projects are similar in that they all use and adapt stage planning procedures but each project is unique with its own set of problems and solutions. An organisation may have an archive of documented projects that will provide information to achieve timely solutions to similar issues, this information needs to be accessible and verifiable, which means an accurate and reliable means of storing and maintaining previous mistakes made and the lessons learnt. A strategy to reduce the risk involved with CM and provide a sustainable product that offers greater value may be achieved within a methodical and systematic approach, which promotes a collaborative environment through each stage of a project’s lifecycle.</p>

    <p>4D BIM is the integration of a 3D information model and a task defined project completion schedule model.</p>
    <p>Effective planning for a 4D BIM project in alignment with relevant industry standards can provide assurances to stakeholders that the use of 4D BIM enables a construction project with the ability to be completed through a collaborative network of project stakeholders. A collaboration process is an integral part of a BIM project, which requires informed decisions based on the employers information requirements (EIR). The EIR states a need for scheduled data exchanges and required 4D models from each architectural, engineering and construction (AEC) discipline. Clash detection of a discipline(s) specific 4D BIM models are merged together to update the reference file, along with review mark-ups, (such as tags, viewpoints and/or comments) which are updated in a sequential process as stipulated in the EIR to correspond with the design changes that are made.</p>
    <p>This facilitates a means of sub-contractor discussions to alleviate clashes of model elements before the construction stage of a 4D BIM project.</p>
    <br>
    <p>A general understanding is that successful CM requires meticulous “front-end planning” to calculate the project duration through a continuous method of validation, where planned schedule productivity is compared against actual schedule productivity throughout the construction of the project. The planning process can provide a project with the ability to verify project objectives, assess possible risk factors and provide required solutions. 4D BIM is considered a powerful tool when used in CM planning, which presents the virtual construction (VC) of a federated model that incorporates each AEC discipline’s 4D BIM model, linked to the project schedule and are further defined by linking model elements to time specific tasks.</p>

    <p>The adoption of BIM and 4D BIM within the construction process provides an effective means of collaboration to all stakeholders, to communicate planned work, design element clashes and design alternatives, which are visualised through a 4D BIM simulation of planned workflows. Although arguments can be made, that the threat to the widespread use of 4D BIM is hindered by the shortage of expert knowledge on the use of 4D BIM technology. There is a requirement to understand the strategic methods of analysing data from a 4D model put in place to enable optimum efficiency throughout the CM process, which in turn can provide a greater degree of certainty to time, cost and quality of a CM project.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The beneficial effects that 4D BIM enables in CM may include the ability to:</p>
    <li>win project tendering based on an organisation’s previous 4D BIM project success</li>
    <li>analyse previous 4D models for solutions to issues, which may be similar</li>
    <li>improve communication through better visualisation of the project plan</li>
    <li>visually identify building element clashes before construction starts</li>
    <li>alternative design options</li>
    <li>determine site logistics</li>
    <li>analyse visual representation of construction sequences</li>
    <li>improve schedule estimation</li>
    <li>reduce project schedule duration</li>
    <li>improve information quality</li>
