    <p>The purpose of this analytical process is to incorporate a decision support system (DSS) to aid in the decision making process involved in construction management (CM) to decide, which 4D BIM software application is best suited to a construction project established from a project specific set of requirements. This process involves the analysis of three 4D BIM software applications (navisworks, synchro and asta powerproject), with an aggregate score rating offered by a 4D BIM professional. Score ratings are offered for the person’s project involvement and their experiences in a professional capacity, with one of the three software applications, which corresponds to a specific project. This information will be stored in a computer program’s data base, which has been developed as a world.wide.web. (w.w.w.) based DSS, this will act as a reference for a recommendation that is established from a set of project specific constraints and the correlation made between similar CM projects. Score ratings for each of nine 4D BIM attributes are scored on their ability to improve the CM process, the data will be used to populate and develop the computer program’s data base over a period of time. Containing relevant data, showing the evaluation of task specific capabilities and the proficiency to enable successful CM, through the use of 4D BIM technology.</p>
    <br>
    <p>It is the aim of this program to make a project specific recommendation derived from information taken from a number of 4D BIM professionals, the experience gained from the prior use of the 4D BIM software application and the relevant conclusions that were made. A series of back links will be shown that directs a person to the web site of the organisation and/or project for which the 4D BIM professional has based a recommendation. This information will provide others with a recommendation based on, which of the three 4D BIM software applications to use for a planned project, assessed from a number of project specific constraints and the subsequent planned 4D BIM requirements. To define a projects constraints a classification method has been developed to represent both a planned project and a completed project. To offer a greater understanding of project similarities a 4D BIM professional will offer opinions established from the ability of each 4D BIM attribute to enhance the improvement of CM, established through the use of the 4D BIM software application defined by a set of CM constraints. Both the user looking for a recommendation and the 4D professional offering a knowledge based recommendation are presented with a series of choices to define their requirements of a 4D BIM software application. The choices are structured from an established project management tool known as ‘the iron triangle’, which states that a series of three project management constraints are common to all construction projects and can be categorised into three groups.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">A project specific set of constraints are derived from a list of three elements: time, cost and quality.</p>
    <p>To reinforce the DSS process, these three elements are further defined by creating three sub-sets, each of, which offer the ability to establish the specific project requirement definitions.</p>
