            Risk Mitigation

    <p>4D BIM offers an ability to a CM team to manage risk and reduce risk variants throughout a projects lifecycle against the probability of time delays (requests for information (RFI)’s) and subsequent cost increases. Other opportunities include the identification, assessment and quantification of risks at each stage of a project. This is made possible through a means of collaborative communication between project stakeholders and the visualisation of VC and 4D BIM technology.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Visual Comparison between Traditional and the 4D BIM approach in Construction Management</p>
    <br>
    <p>A combination of existing risk management practices, BIM and the evolution of 4D BIM technology is instrumental in reducing the negative risk probabilities involved with CM tasks. Which increases safety assurances whilst maintaining organisational management to ensure consistent project productivity. The capability to provide stakeholders with visual recognition of actual construction progress compared to the project schedule presents equivocal evidence of risk mitigation. CM based on a successful business template incorporates a risk management framework into a 4D BIM project management strategy at design and subsequent planning stages, involving the risk analysis of data systematically collated according to the EIR. The use of information construction technology (ICT) and 4D BIM to provide the management team with detailed work in progress (WIP) data in real-time is analysed through collaboration techniques and dynamic information is derived.</p>
    <p>The management of sub-contractors in accordance with the CM process can be seen to be simplified through the manipulation of 4D BIM and the ability to link discipline specific work schedules with planned construction tasks. This in-turn provides the ability for visualisation of building element clashes, through a virtual representation. The ability of 4D BIM to show clashes before they happen at design stage means, that alternative designs can be visualised and compared with the planned construction schedule. Clash detection is validated through collaboration and coordination of sub-contractor management teams, reducing the risk of a dis-jointed construction management process. Discrete-event-simulation (DES) allows the simulation of a specific task and a means of insuring effective resource allocation is used and that productivity can be optimised to provide assurance that the project keeps to the schedule. Collaboration amongst multiple AEC disciplines to analyse a series of location based WBS’s within the project schedule to visualise DES through 4D BIM technology and provide the information necessary to detect location, element or resource clashes and allows for changes to be made accordingly. 4D BIM can be used as a means of capturing and visualising a project in real-time at any stage throughout construction, to enable regular checks of planned outputs against actual outputs based on pre-defined quality requirements to provide quality assurance. The addition of a WBS to the planned schedule, which is linked to the 4D BIM model can provide the CM team with a detailed framework of specific tasks, associated to specific construction area’s that align resources i.e. operatives, materials and plant at any given time throughout construction. Regular collaboration meetings between sub-contractors and those of the CM team with the relevant knowledge to interpret collated data. Which is analysed and the information that is procured, together with continuous coordinated visual monitoring and testing can establish if there are discrepancies between planned and actual productivity outputs for specific tasks.</p>
